# Dria-Node-Run-Full-Guide

## Introduction
Dria is the only synthetic data infrastructure that you can balance data quality, diversity, and complexity all together in a single interface. A framework for creating, managing, and orchestrating synthetic data pipelines. A multi-agent network that can synthesize data from web and siloed sources.

## Key Features
- Decentralized Knowledge Sharing: A decentralized network where users globally can upload, share, and access knowledge securely using AI, emphasizing collective intelligence and permissionless access.
- Synthetic Data Generation: Generates high-quality, diverse synthetic data for AI/ML models using a multi-agent network of thousands of AI agents working collaboratively.
- AI-Powered Tools: Features advanced AI capabilities, including Dria-Agent-α, a 3B-parameter language model optimized for Pythonic function calling, matching GPT-4o performance with enhanced reasoning and parallel multi-function support.
- Scalable Infrastructure: Utilizes thousands of nodes for parallelized inference, producing up to ~10K tokens of data per second, offloading compute tasks to the network so users don’t need personal GPUs.
- Customizable Data Pipelines: Offers the Dria SDK for building and executing synthetic data generation pipelines, supporting custom Pydantic schemas and integration with 50+ models (e.g., OpenAI, Gemini, Ollama) for structured, high-quality outputs.
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): Provides a drag-and-drop public RAG model that converts uploaded knowledge (e.g., PDFs, podcasts, CSVs) into retrievable formats, stored permanently on Arweave for universal access.
- Reward System: Enables knowledge uploaders to earn rewards based on the value of their contributions, which can be redeemed to upload or query additional knowledge, encouraging ecosystem participation.
- Permissionless Access: Allows developers and users to run RAG models locally via smart contracts, accessing global knowledge without intermediaries, promoting an open and collaborative environment.

## Airdrop Details
- Knowledge Uploaders: Users contributing valuable data (e.g., PDFs, podcasts, CSVs) to Dria’s public RAG models or Arweave storage might qualify, aligning with the platform’s reward system.
- Node Operators: Individuals running nodes to support Dria’s scalable infrastructure (thousands of nodes, ~10K tokens/second) could be eligible.
- Early Adopters: Developers or users engaging with the Dria SDK or testing AI agents (e.g., Dria-Agent-α) might be rewarded.
